# How to run
## Compile:
```
javac peerProcess.java
javac StartRemotePeers.java
```

## Run
```
java StartRemotePeers
```

# Files

## peerProcess.java

This contains the main method. Holds a reference for other objects like the logger and the file writer

## MessageType.java

This just defines an enum for the message type  

## Logger.java

The Logger writes the logs

## README.md

You are literally reading the ReadMe

## Client.java

This is the client code. The starting point of this was the Client.java from Canvas  

## Server.java

This is the server code. The starting point of this was the Server.java from Canvas

## FileHandler.java

This is for writing to the destination files

## StartRemotePeers

Code for starting multiple peers automatically. It is not essential. The code used to work in the CISE environment. But, it is now known to have problems due to SSH. If you can get it to work, it can be helpful(see also the next file). Otherwise, you can always start peers manually. See the project description for explanation.

## startpeers-from-students

Code and instruction for getting around the SSH problem. This was discovered by some student group.
