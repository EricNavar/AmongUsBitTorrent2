## Progress

For the first check we have to have 800 lines of runnable code.

peerProcess.java:       214
MessageType.java:       3
Logger.java:            78
RemotePeerInfo.java:    23
StartRemotePeers.java   85

Total:                  403

# Files

## peerProcess.java

This contains the main method

## MessageType.java

This just defines an enum for the message type

## Logger.java

The Logger logs whenever a connection or message is received.

## README.md

You are literally reading the ReadMe

## SampleCodeFromCanvas

This is all sample code from Canvas

## Client.java

This is the client code. The starting point of this was the Client.java from Canvas

## Server.java

This is the server code. The starting point of this was the Server.java from Canvas

## StartRemotePeers

Code for startingmultiple peers automatically. It is not essential. The code used to work in the CISE environment. But, it is now known to have problems due to SSH. If you can get it to work, it can be helpful(see also the next file). Otherwise, you can always start peers manually. See the project description for explanation.

## startpeers-from-students

Code and instruction for getting around the SSH problem. This was discovered by some student group.
